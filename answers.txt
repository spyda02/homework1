What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

Both commands are used to integrate changes from one branch to another, but they go about doing this action in different ways. 
Merge links the branches into a new commit on the current branch. Rebase combines the changes from one branch to another by fully 
rewriting all of original branch's commits. 

What is a remote repository?

A remote repository is the central online repository that all collaborators can see.
